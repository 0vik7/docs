# Text markup for speech synthesis

You can control pronunciation during speech synthesis by marking up text to synthesize. {{ speechkit-full-name }} fully supports markup for texts in Russian only. Some pronunciation control features are also supported for other languages.



In {{ speechkit-name }}, there are two markup formats:

* [TTS](tts-markup.md): For API v1 and API v3.
* [SSML](ssml.md): For API v1 only.
