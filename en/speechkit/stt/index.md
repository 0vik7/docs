# Speech recognition

_Speech recognition (speech-to-text, STT)_ is the process of converting speech to text. The service can recognize spontaneous speech in several languages.

## Languages {#langs}

* Russian
* English
* Turkish

## Language models {#model}

SpeechKit has a two-stage approach to speech recognition. At the first stage, the audio signal is analyzed to detect sequences of sounds that could be interpreted as words. For each sequence of sounds, there are usually several possible words (or hypotheses).

The second stage applies a _language model_, which allows you to validate each hypothesis in terms of the language structure and context, i.e., to what extent a given word is consistent with other words that have already been recognized. The speech recognition system uses the language model as a dictionary to validate the hypotheses. Creating a dictionary like this is a complex computational task involving deep learning.

A neural network is trained on speech samples that are typical for a particular domain. That's why the language models are optimized for recognizing speech from a specific domain. For example, the _Numbers_ model is the best choice for phone number recognition, while a person's first and last name are best recognized using the _Names_ model.

The supported language models are listed below.

**[!TAB Russian]**

* _Queries_ (`general`) — Short phrases containing 3-5 words on various topics, including search engine or website queries.
For example:
    * _покажи следующий поворот_
    * _соединить с отделом продаж_
    * _еще чашку кофе и две мягких французских булочки_
    * _какая погода во владивостоке_
    * _напомни купить овощей и фруктов по дороге домой_
* _Addresses_ (`maps`) — Addresses and names of companies or geographical features:
    * _поехали на улицу кирпичные выемки пять_
    * _сколько ехать от льва толстого до новой земли_
    * _покажи маршрут до музея маяковского_
* _Dates_ (`dates`) — Names of months, ordinal numbers, and cardinal numbers:
    * _второго ноль седьмого две тысячи первого_
    * _двадцать седьмое апреля тысяча девятьсот девятнадцатого года_
* _Names_ (`names`) — First and last names and phone call requests:
    * _щукин платон_
    * _соедините с людчиком_
    * _переговорить с васей васиным_
* _Numbers_ (`numbers`) — Cardinal numbers from 1 to 999 and delimiters (dot, comma, and dash). This model can be used to dictate phone numbers, account numbers, or document numbers:
    * _два двенадцать восемьдесят пять ноль шесть_
    * _сто пятьдесят семь запятая пятнадцать сорок три_

**[!TAB English]**

* _Queries_ (`general`) — Short phrases containing 3-5 words on various topics, including search engine or website queries:
    * _connect me to the sales department_
    * _another cup of coffee and two soft French rolls_
* _Addresses_ (`maps`) — Addresses and names of companies or geographical features:
    * _go to Abbey Road_

**[!TAB Turkish]**

* _Queries_ (`general`) — Short phrases containing 3-5 words on various topics, including search engine or website queries:
    * _satış departmanıyla görüşmek istiyorum_
    * _bir kahve daha ve iki küçük kurabiye_
* _Addresses_ (`maps`) — Addresses and names of companies or geographical features:
    * _Atatürk Bulvarı'na git_

The models are trained on large datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve the quality of speech recognition.

## Recognition quality {#speed_and_accuracy}

The accuracy of recognition depends on the quality of the source sound, audio encoding quality, clarity and rate of speech, as well as phrase complexity and length. It is important that the speech topic matches the chosen language model because this improves the accuracy of recognition.
