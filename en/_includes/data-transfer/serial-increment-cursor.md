{% cut "Specifics of periodic incremental copying for {{ PG }}" %}

If in your transfers from {{ PG }} you specify, in the **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.transfer.console.form.transfer.IncrementalTable.key_column.title }}** setting, the `SERIAL` field or the field generated by `SEQUENCE` and enable periodic incremental copying, the columns created in parallel threads might not be added to the next snapshot of the source and won't get transferred to the target. This is because `SEQUENCE` in {{ PG }} [is agnostic of transaction sequence](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html): for the previously completed transaction, the value in the cursor column might be higher than for the transaction completed afterwards.
