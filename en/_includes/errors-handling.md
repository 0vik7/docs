# Handling errors

If an operation completes successfully, the server returns the OK status to the client. If an error occurs during the operation, the server returns a message with the error description.

Errors in APIs are described using the [google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) message. This error model is used in both gRPC and REST interfaces.

The [error-list](#table) provides a list of errors currently generated by APIs.

## Error message format {#error-message-format}

The `Status` message contains three fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `code` | <b>int32</b></br>gRPC error code. Possible error codes are defined in [google.rpc.Code](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto). |
| `message` | <b>string</b></br>Error description. |
| `details` | <b>repeated google.protobuf.Any</b></br>Error details. This field contains detailed information about the error, such as which parameters were specified incorrectly.</br> </br>Message types used in this field are defined in [google.rpc.ErrorDetails](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto). |

Below is a gRPC description of the `Status` message:

```protobuf
message Status {
  // gRPC error code. Possible values are defined
  // in [google.rpc.Code].
  int32 code = 1;

  // Error description.
  string message = 2;

  // Error details.
  repeated google.protobuf.Any details = 3;
}
```

## HTTP mapping {#http-mapping}

Mapping of gRPC statuses to HTTP codes is described in [google.rpc.Code](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto).

The example below shows an error that can be returned by the server in response to a REST request:

```json
 {
   "error": {
     "code": "499",
     "message": "The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.",
     "status": "CANCELLED",
     "details": [{
       "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.RetryInfo",
       ...
     }]
   }
 }
```

## List of possible errors {#error-list}

| HTTP | gRPC | Error description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 400 | INVALID_ARGUMENT | Incorrect request parameters specified. Details are provided in the `details` field. |
| 401 | UNAUTHENTICATED | The operation requires authentication. |
| 403 | PERMISSION_DENIED | The user has no permissions required to perform the operation. |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND | The requested resource not found. |
| 409 | ALREADY_EXISTS | Attempt to create a resource that already exists. |
| 429 | RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED | The request limit exceeded. |
| 499 | CANCELLED | The operation was aborted on the client side. |
| 500 | UNKNOWN | Unknown error. |
| 500 | INTERNAL | Internal server error. This error means that the operation cannot be performed due to a server-side technical problem. For example, due to insufficient computing resources. |
| 501 | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | The operation is not supported by the service. |
| 503 | UNAVAILABLE | The service is currently unavailable. Try again in a few seconds. |
