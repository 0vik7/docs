You can only create snapshots of replicated network disks. To work with [non-replicated disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types) and disks residing in [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), use [{{ backup-full-name }}](../../backup/) (this service is at the Preview stage and only supports Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows Server).
