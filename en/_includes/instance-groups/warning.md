> When creating a group, keep the [limits](../../instance-groups/concepts/limits.md) in mind. Not to disrupt the component [!KEYREF instance-groups-name], do not update or delete manually created resources: [target group](../../load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) [!KEYREF load-balancer-name], virtual machines and disks. To do this, update or delete the instance group.
