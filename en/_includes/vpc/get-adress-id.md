To get the address ID, use the [list](../../vpc/api-ref/Address/list) REST API method for the [Address](../../vpc/api-ref/Address/index.md) resource or the [AddressService/List](../../vpc/api-ref/grpc/address_service.md#List) gRPC API call and provide the folder ID in the `folderId` request parameter.
