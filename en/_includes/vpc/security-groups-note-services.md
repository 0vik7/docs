Security groups are at the [Preview stage](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md). If they are not available on your network, all incoming and outgoing traffic will be allowed for the resources. No additional setup is required.

To enable security groups, request access to this feature from the [support team]({{ link-console-support }}/create-ticket).
