* If the issue start dates and deadlines are not shown on the chart, hover the mouse pointer over the chart next to the issue name, position the bar along the time axis, and click the left mouse button.

* To shift the start date and deadline by the same value, drag the bar along the time access.

* To change the issue duration, drag the left edge of the bar (the start date) or the right edge of the bar (deadline).

* To set up automatic update of start dates and deadlines for dependent issues, go to ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg)&nbsp;**Chart settings** and enable **Automatically move the deadline of the dependent issue when the blocking issue deadline changes**. If the deadline of the blocking issue is later than the start date of the dependent issue, this start date is shifted based on the blocking issue's new deadline.
