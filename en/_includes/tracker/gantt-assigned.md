On the Gantt chart, you can appoint or change the issue's assignee.

For this, on the issue bar, click the user icon and select the name of the employee to set as assignee.

{% note info %}

If you do not see the user icon, go to ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg)&nbsp;**Chart settings** and select the **assignee** item in **Show on the issue bar**.

{% endnote %}
