When a VM is stopped, its public IP address is released, and the next time the VM is started, it gets a new public IP address. When the VM is restarted, its public IP address is saved.

A public IP address can be made static. 

Pricing for IP addresses is detailed on the page [[!TITLE]](../vpc/pricing.md#prices-public-ip) of documentation for [!KEYREF vpc-name].
