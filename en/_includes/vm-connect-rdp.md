Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is enabled for images of all versions and editions of the Windows operating system prepared for Yandex.Cloud. You can connect to a VM using the RDP protocol when it is running (with the "RUNNING" status).

To connect using RDP, specify the public IP address or the FQDN of the VM. Access via FQDN is possible from another Yandex.Cloud VM, if it is connected to the same network. You can find out the IP address and FQDN in the management console. Go to the **Network** section on the virtual machine's page.
