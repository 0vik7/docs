The role of `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-owner]` is assigned for the cloud and makes the user the [owner of the cloud](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#owner). The owner can perform any operations with the cloud and its resources.

Only the cloud owner can assign to or remove from the users the role `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-owner]`.

A cloud must have at least one owner. The sole owner of a cloud may not give up this role.
