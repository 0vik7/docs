# Publish a form

The form is available for filling out immediately after it's created. You can publish the form using a direct link, embed it in a site, or share a link to the form on social media. If you use [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md), you can embed the form on a {{ wiki-full-name }} page.


When publishing a form, you can [limit](restrictions.md) the date range for submitting responses and the total number of responses. You can also restrict access by only allowing responses from employees in your {{ org-full-name }} organization.

You can make changes to the form and its settings even after publication.
