# Publish a form

The form is available for filling out immediately after it's created. You can publish the form using a direct link, embed it in a site, or share a link to the form on social media. If you use [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md), you can [embed the form on a {{ wiki-full-name }}](../wiki/actions/forms.md) page.

When publishing a form, you can [set restrictions](restrictions.md) by date and the total number of responses  or allow only employees of your organization to fill out the form {{ org-full-name }}.

You can make changes to the form and its settings even after publication.
