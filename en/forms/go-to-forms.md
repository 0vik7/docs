# How to choose a version of {{ forms-full-name }}



{{ forms-full-name }} can be used for personal matters, for example, to interview friends and make a menu for a New Year's party. Or you can use forms for business, for example, to accept orders for your online store.

- To create [a personal form](personal-forms.md), go to [{{ link-forms-admin }}]({{ link-forms-admin }}) and [log in to your Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}).

- To create [a form for business](forms-for-org.md), go to [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}) and [log in to the organization employee's account](login.md).

To switch between personal forms and forms for business, go to {{ forms-full-name }} and click **Personal forms** or **Forms for business** in the upper-right corner of the page.
