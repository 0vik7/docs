# Service plan

A _service plan_ is the cost of using a software product for {{ marketplace-short-name }} users. A service plan must include:
* Product asking price, which is the amount the publisher would like to receive for his or her product, without VAT.
* Fee in the amount of 20% of the product asking price that is charged by {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* VAT.

If payment is at the end of a billing cycle, {{ yandex-cloud }} will deduct the fee and VAT from the rate if your legal entity does not pay VAT.

Different service plans are available for different types of products.
