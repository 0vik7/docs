## What goes into the cost of using {{ mmg-short-name }} {#rules}

The cost of {{ mmg-name }} usage is based on:

{% include [pricing-rules](../_includes/mdb/pricing-rules.md) %}

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the allocated computing resources. Supported resource configurations are listed in the [{#T}](concepts/instance-types.md) section, prices for using vCPU and RAM — in the [Prices](#prices) section.

The minimum billing unit is a minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host usage cost the same as 2 minutes). You are not charged for time when the {{ MG }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

The following is charged:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.
    * Storage on fast local disks (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 3 hosts:
        * For Intel Broadwell and Intel Cascade Lake: In increments of 100 GB.
        * For Intel Ice Lake: In increments of {{ local-ssd-v3-step }}.

* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage specified for the cluster.

    * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the database and all backups is less than the storage volume selected.

    * During an automatic backup, {{ mmg-short-name }} doesn't create a new copy, but saves changes to the database compared to the previous copy. This means that storage used by automatic backups increases only in proportion to the volume of changes that are made.

    * The number of hosts in the cluster does not affect the size of the storage or free backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use.  The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).
