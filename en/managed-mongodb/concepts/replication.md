# Replication {{ MG }}

{{ mmg-name }} clusters support replication by default: if a cluster has multiple active hosts, the primary server that handles write requests is automatically selected.

{% include [non-replicating-hosts](../../_includes/mdb/non-replicating-hosts.md) %}

For more information about how replication works in {{ MG }}, read the [DBMS documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/).
