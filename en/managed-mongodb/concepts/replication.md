Managed Service for MongoDB clusters support replication by default: if a cluster has multiple active hosts, the primary server that handles write requests is automatically selected among them.

For more information about how replication works in MongoDB, read the [DBMS documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/).
