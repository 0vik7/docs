# Getting started withÂ [!KEYREF resmgr-full-name]

When a user registers with Yandex.Cloud, a _cloud_ is created for the user. The cloud is a separate workspace with this user as the owner.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently, users cannot create clouds themselves.

The owner can create folders and resources in this cloud, and manage access rights to them.

1. To create your first folder in the cloud:

    [!INCLUDE [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md)]

2. Grant users access to the folder you have created:
    1. In the management console, click ![image](../_assets/ugly-sandwich.svg) and go to **Access management**.
    2. Select the **Users and roles** tab.
    3. In the line with the appropriate user name, click **Set up roles**.
    4. Make sure that the user has one of the following roles for the cloud: `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]` or `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-owner]`.
    5. Select a folder in **Roles in folders**  and click **Assign role**.
    6. Select a role from the list. For example, grant the user access to create resources in the folder by assigning the role of `[!KEYREF roles-editor]`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When you create a new user in the cloud, he is automatically assigned the role of `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]` for this cloud. This role is necessary for the user to access resources in the cloud. The role of `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]` is used in combination with other roles, such as `[!KEYREF roles-admin]`, `[!KEYREF roles-editor]` or `[!KEYREF roles-viewer]`. For more information about roles, see the [Roles](../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) section.
