Before working, you need to register in {{yandex-cloud }} and create a billing account:

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or sign up if don't already have an account.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you linked a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md), and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md).

If you have an active billing account, you can create or select a folder to run your VM in from the [{{ yandex-cloud }} page]({{ link-console-cloud }}).
