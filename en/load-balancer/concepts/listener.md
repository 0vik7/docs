## Listener

*A listener* is a virtual service responsible for receiving traffic via the specified IP, port, and data communication protocol. Ports ranging from 1 to 32767 can be used for receiving traffic.

A listener is configured when creating a new load balancer. Targets to which traffic will be routed must receive it on the same port as the one specified in the listener configuration.

You can create a load balancer without any listener.
