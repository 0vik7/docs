# Revoke role for a resource

If you want to prohibit a user from accessing a resource, revoke relevant roles for this resource from the user.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you need to temporarily revoke all access rights from a user, you can just revoke the role of `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]`. Although the user keeps all the other roles, they can't perform any operations with the cloud resources. When you add the user to the cloud again, the access rights are already configured.
