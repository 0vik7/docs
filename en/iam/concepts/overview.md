# Purpose of [!KEYREF iam-full-name]

The [!KEYREF iam-full-name] ([!KEYREF iam-short-name]) service allows you to control access to Yandex Cloud resources. You determine what rights other users should have, while [!KEYREF iam-short-name] checks that the user actually has such rights.

You can grant access to a specific user, group of users, or service account. For more information about types of users, see the section [[!TITLE]](users/users.md).

To grant access rights, you grant a user a role for a resource. To learn which roles are available in Yandex Cloud, read the section [[!TITLE]](access-control/roles.md). To learn how to assign a role, see the section [[!TITLE]](access-control/access-bindings.md).

For [!KEYREF iam-short-name] to check the applicable user's rights, the user has to go through the authorization process. To learn about user steps to access the resource, see [[!TITLE]](authorization/authorization.md).
