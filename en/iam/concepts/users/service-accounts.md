# Service accounts

_A service account_ is an account that can be used by your program to perform actions in Yandex Cloud. A service account can manage other resources via the API.

The service account is a resource: just like a virtual machine, a service account is created inside a folder. You can grant or revoke access rights to the service account for other users.

At the moment, service accounts are used to access resources of the [!KEYREF objstorage-full-name] service. For more information, see the section [[!TITLE]](../../../storage/s3/index.md) in the [!KEYREF objstorage-name] documentation.
