# IAM token

An IAM token (or just token) is a unique sequence of characters issued to a user after authentication. The user needs this token for authorization in the Yandex.Cloud API and access to resources.

[!INCLUDE [iam-token-usage](../../../_includes/iam-token-usage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iam-token-lifetime](../../../_includes/iam-token-lifetime.md)]

In the management console and the command line interface (CLI), the token is obtained and used without the user needing to do anything.
