# Roles

_A role_ is a set of user permissions to perform operations with Yandex Cloud resources.

When you assign a role, you specify the assigned subject and a resource to which the role applies. The subject can be a normal user, service account, or system subject. A subject can be assigned multiple roles for the same resource. For more information, see the section [[!TITLE]](access-bindings.md).

There are two types of roles:

- _Common roles_ are the roles that can be assigned to any Yandex Cloud resources. These are the roles of `[!KEYREF roles-admin]`, `[!KEYREF roles-editor]` and `[!KEYREF roles-viewer]`.

- _Service roles_ are the roles created for a specific service. The service role identifier is specified in the `service.resources.role`  format. For example, the role of `[!KEYREF roles-image-user]` allows you to use images in the Yandex Compute Cloud service.

    A service role cannot be assigned for any resource. It can only be assigned to the resource the role is intended for. For example, `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]` can only be assigned for a cloud.

    A service role can also be assigned for resources that access rights are inherited from. For example, `[!KEYREF roles-image-user]` can be assigned for a folder or cloud, because images inherit access rights from them.

Currently, users are not allowed to create new roles with a specific set of permissions.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To access a resource, you may need to have multiple roles at the same time. For example, to view information about a folder in a cloud, just the `[!KEYREF roles-viewer]` role is not enough â€” you also need the role of `[!KEYREF roles-cloud-member]` in this cloud. Read more in the section [[!TITLE]](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md) in the Yandex Resource Manager documentation.
