# Restrict page viewing

You can restrict access to a page for other users if you are the page's owner:

1. Open the page.

1. At the top of the page, click the button that displays the page's access status (**Available to all employees** is set by default).

1. Specify who will be able to view the page:

   * **Same as the parent page**: The access level is carried over from the parent page.

   * **All staff employees**: All employees of your organization.

   * **Only authors**: Only the page owners can view and edit the page.

   * **Specific employees**: Specify the usernames of people to be granted viewing and editing access.

   {% note alert %}

   Changing access settings for [{{ wiki-name }} home page]({{ link-homepage }}) is not recommended.

   By default, the owner of the {{ wiki-name }} home page is a service account. If this page's access mode is set to "Only page owners", all other users will be blocked from accessing the page. To make the page accessible to other users, follow the link [{{ link-homepage-access }}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) to change access settings.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click **Save**.

Users who don't have access to the page will not be able to view or edit it. You can also allow viewing and [prohibit users from editing the page](read-only.md).
