# Prohibit page editing

By default, all users who have access to a page can edit it. You can make the page read-only if you are the page's owner:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/ico-actions.png) **Action** and go to **Settings**.

1. In the **Page Settings** window, enable **Only the author can edit the page**. Users who have [access to the page](access-setup.md) will be able to view it. However, they won't be able to edit the page.

    {% note info %}

    The organization [admin](../overview.md#access) can edit the page even if the page owner restricted editing access. 

    {% endnote %}

1. To disable comments on the page, click the **Comments** line, select **Disabled**, and click **Save**.
