# Editing a list of page authors

A page can have one or more authors. The main author is the page [owner](#edit-owner). By default, this is the user who created it. The owner's name is indicated above the page title. All other authors are called co-authors and have the same rights as the page owner.

A new author of the page can be assigned by its current author or the organization administrator.
