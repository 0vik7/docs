# Page types

{{ wiki-full-name }} supports multiple types of pages. You can select a type when creating a page, but you can't change the type after you save it.

## Old editor {#page}

You can use the old editor to create a common page with text, images, tables, attached files, and more. You can create content manually or upload an existing text file. Use the [markup language](static-markup.md) to format text.

* [{#T}](create-page.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)

## Table {#grid}

This type allows you to create dynamic tables are tables where users can specify data types in columns, sort values, and make cells required. You can use a table directly or [embed it in a page](add-grid.md).

* [{#T}](create-grid.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)

## New editor {#wysiwyg}

You can use the new editor to create a page where you can work with text as usual, just as you do in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The visual editor only works on pages created in the new editor.

* [{#T}](wysiwyg-create.md)
* [{#T}](wysiwyg-edit.md)
