# Page types

{{ wiki-full-name }} supports multiple types of pages: You can select a page type when creating your page. However, you won't be able to change it after you save the page.

## Wiki page {#page}

A page with text, images, tables, attached files, and so on. You can add content to your Wiki page in the browser or upload a text file.

* [{#T}](create-page.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)

## Note {#note}

A page in your Notes section (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). Notes can only be seen by you by default, but you can always change the access rights.

* [{#T}](create-note.md)

## Dynamic table {#grid}

Dynamic tables are used to sort values, specify data types to display in columns, and set required cells. You can use the table as-is or [embed it on a Wiki page](add-grid.md#grid).

* [{#T}](create-grid.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)
