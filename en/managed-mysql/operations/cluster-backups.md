# How to manage backups

You can create backups and restore clusters from existing backups.

## Restoring clusters from backups {#restore}

When you restore a cluster from a backup, you create a new cluster with the data from the backup. If the folder has insufficient [resources](../concepts/limits.md) to create such a cluster, you will not be able to restore from the backup.

For a new cluster, you should set all the parameters that are required at creation, except for the cluster type (a [!KEYREF CH] backup cannot be restored as a [!KEYREF MY] cluster).
