# Getting started with {{ mmy-name }}Â®

To get started with the service:
* [Create a DB cluster](#cluster-create).
* [Connect to the DB](#connect).


## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or sign up if you don't have an account yet.
1. If you don't have a folder yet, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. You can connect to DB clusters from both inside and outside {{ yandex-cloud }}:
* To connect to a DB cluster from inside {{ yandex-cloud }}, create a VM in the same cloud network as the DB cluster (with [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) or [Windows](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-windows.md)).
* To be able to connect to the cluster from the internet, request public access to hosts when creating the cluster.

{% note info %}

The next step assumes that you connect to the cluster from a [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md)-based VM.

{% endnote %}

1. [Connect](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH.
1. Install the necessary dependencies and the MySQL client:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mysql-client
   ```

## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
1. Select **{{ mmy-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. When the cluster is ready, its status on the {{ mmy-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

## Connect to the DB {#connect}

1. [Configure security groups](operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) for the cloud network to enable all the relevant traffic between the cluster and the connecting host.
1. To connect to the DB server, get an SSL certificate:

   
   1. Create a folder:

      ```bash
      mkdir ~/.mysql
      ```

   1. Get a certificate:

      ```bash
      wget "https://{{ s3-storage-host }}{{ pem-path }}" -O ~/.mysql/root.crt
      ```

   1. Configure permissions to the certificate:

      ```
      chmod 0600 ~/.mysql/root.crt
      ```

1. Use the `mysql` command to connect:

   ```bash
   mysql --host=<host address> \
     --port=3306 \
     --ssl-ca=~/.mysql/root.crt \
     --ssl-mode=REQUIRED \
     --user=<name of database user> \
     --password <DB name>
   ```
