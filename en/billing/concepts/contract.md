# Agreement

In Yandex.Cloud, all services are rendered under an agreement that you accept when you create a [billing account](billing-account.md). The agreement does not need to be signed by both parties.

Once the offer has been accepted, both parties start acting under the agreement in accordance with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. The agreement stipulates that you shall pay for the resources consumed at the end of the reporting period. For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).

The agreement number is displayed in the management console on the **Account data** page. You can read the agreement on [Yandex.Legal documents](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/?lang=en) page.

{% note info %}

Businesses may conclude a contract that is signed by both parties. To do this, submit a request using the **Ask a question** form on the [Contact us](https://cloud.yandex.com/support) page. A Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you to discuss the contract signing terms and conditions.
