# Promo code

**A promo code** is a password that allows you to access the Yandex.Cloud management console.

## How to get a promo code {#get-promo}

You can get a promo code as part of Yandex's promotional offer by requesting one on the [Yandex.Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/) page.

Your request will be reviewed within two weeks. As soon as the decision is made, a Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you. If the decision is positive, the promo code will be sent to the email address specified in the request.

## How to activate a promo code {#activate-promocode}

Promo codes can be activated by individuals and businesses with a registered Yandex.Passport account:

- If you don't have an account, [create one](https://passport.yandex.com/registration).
- If you use a social network profile to log in to Yandex, [create a username and password](https://passport.yandex.com/passport?mode=postregistration&create_login=1).

Your phone number must be linked to this account. See detailed instructions in the [Help](https://yandex.com/support/passport/authorization/registration.html) for Yandex.Passport.

## Terms of use and validity period {#terms-of-use}

One promo code can only be linked to one Yandex.Passport account.

The terms of use and the validity period are specified in the message containing the promo code. Activate your promo code before the deadline specified in the message; otherwise, the promo code becomes invalid. The promo code's validity period cannot be extended.
