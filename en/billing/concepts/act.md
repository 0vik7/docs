# Report

A report is a primary accounting document that confirms services rendered. It contains aggregate data on the cost of the services actually rendered. Detailed information about the services rendered is available on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.

## Generating a report {#create-act}

Reports are generated at the end of the billing period for the amount actually used from the [billing account](../concepts/personal-account.md).

Statements are then used as a basis for generating [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md).
