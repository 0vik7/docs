# Grant

A grant is a discount given to a business or individual to use with any of the Yandex.Cloud services. The discount amount corresponds to the grant amount.

## Initial grant {#start}

When [creating your first billing account](../quickstart/index.md), you are given the initial grant for the trial period. For more information about the size of the initial grant and conditions for its use, see the document [Trial period](../../free-trial/).

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Only one initial grant can given to an individual or business.

## Additional grants {#additional}

Additional grants can be provided by the decision of a Yandex.Cloud manager or upon your request to the support service. The amount of additional grants and their validity period are displayed in the management console.

## How to use grants {#how-to-use}

The grant priority depends on its validity period: the earlier it expires, the earlier the grant is used.
