# Questions about the trial period and paid version

#### Is there a trial period for Yandex.Cloud?  {#trial}

Yes, you can. For more information, see the document [Trial period](../../free-trial/).

#### Who can use the trial period? {#who-can-use-trial}

All new Yandex.Cloud customers.

#### I created a new billing account but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

Most likely, you previously created a billing account that used the initial grant. The initial grant can only be issued to one billing account within the trial period.
To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).

#### Can I upgrade to the paid version if the trial period period hasn't expired yet?  {#activate-commercial}

Yes, you can. For more information, see [How to activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).

#### What happens to my resources if I don't upgrade from the trial period to the paid version?  {#commercial}

All your resources will be blocked. For more information, see the document [Trial period](../../free-trial/).
