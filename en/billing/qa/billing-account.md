# Questions about the billing account

#### How many billing accounts can I create? {#account-amount}

Each customer is allowed to create only one billing account.

#### I created a new billing account but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

Most likely, you previously created a billing account that had the trial period activated. During the trial period, your billing account received the initial grant. Since the initial grant can only be given to one billing account, you cannot use the trial period during re-registration. As a result, your new billing account is created with the <q>Suspended</q> status.
To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and [top up your personal account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) for the minimum amount (the minimum amount is shown in the **Top up account** window).

#### How can I enable the credit limit?  {#credit}

[The credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) is enabled automatically after the [paid version is activated](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends.
