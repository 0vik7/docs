# Questions about the billing account

#### How many billing accounts can I create? {#account-amount}

Each customer is allowed to create only one billing account.

#### How do I change my billing account type? {#account-type}

After creating a billing account, you cannot change its type. 

#### I created a new billing account, but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

Most likely, you previously created a billing account that had the trial period activated. During the trial period, your billing account received the initial grant. Since the initial grant can only be given to one billing account, you cannot use the trial period during re-registration. As a result, your new billing account is created with the `SUSPENDED` status.
To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and [top up your personal account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) for the minimum amount (the minimum amount is shown in the **Top up account** window).

#### How can I enable the credit limit?  {#credit}

[The credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) is enabled automatically after the [paid version is activated](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends.

#### I didn't receive an email with instructions on what to do after creating a billing account with the Bank transfer payment method. Why?  {#account-notification}

It may take up to three business days to activate your billing account.
If you haven't received an email within that period, send a request to: [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).

#### I unlinked a bank card from my Yandex.Passport account and now my billing account is blocked. What should I do?  {#account-card}

Your billing account status has been changed to `SUSPENDED` in accordance with [terms and conditions of the agreement (clause 6.11.4.)](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/).
After suspension, an email with instructions on how to restore access was sent to the email address specified in your Yandex or Yandex.Connect account.

#### I can't link a bank card when creating a billing account. What should I do?  {#cant-create}

Most likely, the service does not support your bank card's payment system.

To resolve the issue, try linking a different bank card or, if you are a business owner, create a billing account with the **Business account** type and **Bank transfer** payment method.
