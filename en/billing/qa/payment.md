# Questions about payment

#### Who can pay for resources? {#how-to-buy}

Resources are paid for by crediting funds to an individual [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) as per the [agreement](../concepts/contract.md). Funds can be credited to a personal account by individuals and businesses.

For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).

#### In which currency can I pay for Yandex.Cloud? {#currency}

You must pay for Yandex.Cloud resources in rubles (â‚½), regardless of your legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)) and the country you live in.

#### Can I pay for resources with a bank card in a different currency?  {#currency-2}

Yes.

If you pay for resources with a bank card in a foreign currency, the equivalent amount in rubles, including VAT, is debited from the bank card. Additional bank fees for the currency conversion might be debited or credited a day or two later.

#### I linked a bank card to my billing account. When will money be debited from it? {#unlink-card}

If this is your trial period, funds will not be debited from the bank card you linked.
Since you do not automatically upgrade to the paid version at the end of the trial period, funds are only debited after activating the paid version and using Yandex.Cloud services.

If you upgraded to the paid version and used Yandex.Cloud services, do the following to stop incurring charges:

1. Settle your arrears (if any).
1. Delete all billable service resources.
1. Contact [technical support](https://cloud.yandex.ru/support) to deactivate your account.

#### Will you provide an agreement for the provision and payment of services? {#oferta}

In Yandex.Cloud, all services are rendered under an agreement that you accept when you create a [billing account](../concepts/billing-account.md). The agreement does not need to be signed by both parties.

For more information, see [Agreement](../concepts/contract.md).

#### Can a signed contract be finalized? {#contract}

Businesses may conclude a contract that is signed by both parties. To do this, submit a request using the **Contact the Sales Department** form on the support page. A Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you to discuss the contract signing terms and conditions.

#### How is resource consumption charged?  {#tariffs}

Yandex.Cloud resources are consumed on an as-needed basis. The amount for resources consumed is calculated individually for each service.

For more information, see [Pricing](../pricing.md).
