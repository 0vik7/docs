# Billing and payment currency

You must pay for Yandex.Cloud resources in rubles (â‚½), regardless of your legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)) and the country you live in.

If you pay for resources with a bank card in a foreign currency, the equivalent amount in rubles, including VAT, is debited from the bank card. Additional bank fees for the currency conversion might be debited or credited a day or two later.

The payment procedure is as follows:

1. The payment amount in rubles is reserved on the bank card at the exchange rate valid at the time of payment.
1. The payment is processed within one or two business days. During that period, the exchange rate changes.
1. The amount is now calculated at the new exchange rate: in the event of currency appreciation, the difference is charged; otherwise, it is refunded.
