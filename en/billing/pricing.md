# Pricing policy

In Yandex.Cloud, you can use resources of both billable and non-billable services.

## Non-billable services {#unt-services}

The [Yandex Identity and Access Management](../iam/pricing.md) and [Yandex Resource Manager](../resource-manager/pricing.md) services are always free of charge.

## Billable services {#t-services}

The cost of using billable services is calculated based on the amount of resources consumed and the usage timeframe. The amount of resources consumed is calculated individually for each service.

For more information about billing calculations, see the documentation for the services:
