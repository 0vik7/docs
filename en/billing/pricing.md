# Pricing policy

In Yandex.Cloud, you can use resources of both billable and non-billable services.

## Non-billable services {#free}

The [Yandex Identity and Access Management](../iam/pricing.md) and [Yandex Resource Manager](../resource-manager/pricing.md) services are always free of charge.

## Billable services {#billable}

The cost of using billable services is calculated based on the amount of resources consumed and the usage timeframe. Each service implements its own mechanism for calculating consumed resources.

More information about Cloud prices and pricing policies for every service can be found on the [Pricing](https://cloud.yandex.com/prices) page.
