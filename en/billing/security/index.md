* Activate the [trial period](../trial/activation.md).
* Activate the [paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).
* [Check your costs](../operations/check-diagram.md) and [view usage details](../operations/check-charges.md).
* [Enable the credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md).
* [Change data](../operations/change-data.md) in your billing account.
