# Enable the credit limit

After [the paid version is activated](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends, you may be provided with a [credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) for using the Yandex.Cloud services:

- The credit limit for individuals is enabled automatically.
- Businesses should submit an activation request.

To submit a request:

1. In the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing), click ![image](../../_assets/ugly-sandwich.svg) and go to **Billing**.
1. Select an account on the **List of accounts** page.
1. Click **Switch to post-payment** on the **Overview** page. The request form opens.
1. Fill in all the request fields and attach the following documents:
     - A copy of the certificate of incorporation or business registration.
     - A copy of the decision or minutes on the appointment of the General Director (if you are the General Director).
     - A copy of the power of attorney of the business representative (if you are a representative).
1. Click **Send request**.

Your request will be reviewed within three business days. As soon as the decision is made, a Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you. If the decision is positive, all information about the credit limit will be available in the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing).
