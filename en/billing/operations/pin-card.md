# Link another bank card to your billing account

The owner of a billing account of the **Individual account** or **Business account** type may link different bank cards to it.
A billing account may have only one bank card linked at the same time; however, you can change your card in the billing account settings.
Funds for the consumed resources will only be debited from the bank card specified on the billing account page.

{% include [payment-card-types](../../_includes/billing/payment-card-types.md) %}

{% note info %}

If the selected bank card expires, it will no longer be linked to your billing account. If you have already received a new bank card, add it or select one of the previously added bank cards. You can't change the details of a previously added bank card.

{% endnote %}
