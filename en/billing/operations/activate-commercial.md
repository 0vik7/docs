# Activate the paid version

You need to activate the paid version within thirty days of the trial period expiry. Otherwise, all resources will be deleted automatically.

If you didn't spend the entire amount of the [initial grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md), you can use the remaining amount in the future to pay for resources consumed.

To upgrade to the paid version:

1. In the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing), click ![image](../../_assets/ugly-sandwich.svg) and go to **Billing**.
2. Select an account on the **List of accounts** page.
3. On the **Overview** page, click **Upgrade to the paid version**.
4. Confirm the action by clicking **Upgrade to the paid version** once again.

After you activate the paid version, [the personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) is zero by default. We recommend that you monitor and [top up](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) your personal account balance so that it is always positive.
<br/>If you fail to top up your personal account on time and as a result incur arrears, the use of Yandex.Cloud services may be suspended. For more information, see the section [Billing cycle](../payment/billing-cycle.md).
