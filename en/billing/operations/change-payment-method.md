# Change the payment method

The payment method can only be changed for the billing account of the **Business account** type:  you can only use a transfer from your bank account instead of a transfer from your bank card. To do this, send a request to: [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).

In the request, specify the full name of your company and cloud id and attach the following documents:

  - A copy of the certificate of incorporation or business registration.
  - A copy of the decision or minutes on the appointment of the General Director (if you are the General Director).
  - A copy of the power of attorney of the business representative (if you are a representative).

Your request will be reviewed within three business days. As soon as the decision is made, a Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Once your card is unlinked from your billing account, you will not be able to add a new card. [To top up your personal account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md), you can only use a [transfer of funds from your bank account (via a bank)](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
