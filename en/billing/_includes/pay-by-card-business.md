The payment is usually transferred within 15 to 20 minutes. In accordance with Russian Federal Law No. [FZ-54 "On the use of cash registers"](http://base.garant.ru/12130951/), you will be sent a [payment receipt](../concepts/individual-bill.md) by email.

If the funds cannot be debited within one day, Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to change the status of your billing account to [Suspended](../concepts/billing-account.md#conditions).
