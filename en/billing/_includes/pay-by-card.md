Funds are automatically debited from the bank card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.

{% note info %}

Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the [credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) set.

{% endnote %}


If your bank card balance is insufficient on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later. If the funds cannot be debited within one day, they may be debited from one of the bank cards linked to your Yandex.Passport account.
