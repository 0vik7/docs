# Database classes

A DB class must be selected when creating each cluster. The class determines the computing power to be allocated for each DB host in the cluster.

The available storage does not depend on the database class.  For storage limitations, see the section [[!TITLE]](limits.md).

## Available database classes {#available-flavors}

If you change the DB class, the characteristics of all hosts in the cluster change, too.

| DB class name | Number of processor cores | RAM, GB |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| s1.nano | 1 | 4 |
| s1.micro | 2 | 8 |
| s1.small | 4 | 16 |
| s1.medium | 8 | 32 |
| s1.large | 16 | 64 |
| s1.xlarge | 32 | 128 |
