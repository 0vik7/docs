# Set up a service plan

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the plan that's best for you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The fixed portion only depends on the selected plan, while the supplemental portion is calculated as a fraction of the cost of the resources used over the month. For more information about plans, see the [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).

By default, all users are offered the free basic service plan. To change your service plan:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-support }}), go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.support.switch_plan }}** tab.
1. Select a service plan and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.support.plan.button_submit }}**.
1. To change to:
   * Any service plan except Premium, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.support.plan.popup-confirm_button-submit }}**.
   * The Premium plan, fill out the form and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.support.request-callback.button_submit }}**.

Service plan upgrades are activated immediately, while downgrades are applied on the first day of the following month.
