# Pricing policy for {{ service-name }}

During the Preview stage, {{ service-name }} can be used free of charge.
You can create registries and manage Docker images within the [quotas and limits](concepts/limits.md).

All other Yandex.Cloud services, such as creation of VMs or allocation of external IP addresses, are [charged as usual](../billing/pricing.md). Outgoing traffic is charged similarly to other Yandex.Cloud services, such as [Compute Cloud](../compute/pricing.md#prices-traffic).
