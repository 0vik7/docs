# Repository

_A repository_ is a set that contains the original Docker image and all its versions.

A repository is defined by the `<registry ID>/<image name>` combination.

Tags and digests are used to work with Docker image versions inside the repository. For more information, see the section
[Docker image](docker-image.md).
