# Pricing

By default, all company employees can use {{ tracker-full-name }} for free in [<q>Read only</q>](enable-tracker.md#readonly) mode. Grant [{{ tracker-name }} full access](enable-tracker.md#access) so that your employees can use all of its features.

## Pricing {#sec_price}

The cost of using {{ tracker-name }} is based on the number of users with full access to the platform. You don't have to pay for {{ tracker-name }} if you have a small team. You can subscribe up to 5 employees to {{ tracker-name }} for free.

{% endnote %}

For more information about how to pay for {{ tracker-name }}, see the [Billing service documentation](../billing/index.yaml).

## Cost calculation {#sec_calculate}

How the monthly {{ tracker-name }} subscription fee is calculated:

- The monthly fee is based on the maximum number of users who simultaneously had access to {{ tracker-name }} during the month.

    {% note tip %}

    If you want to add new users to {{ tracker-name }} while simultaneously revoking access for those who no longer use {{ tracker-name }}, we recommend revoking access for old users first and then adding new users. This will give you the lowest number of users with simultaneous access to {{ tracker-name }}.

    {% endnote %}

<!-- - If you accidentally granted access to {{ tracker-name }} to a user or team that won't use {{ tracker-name }}, you can revoke their access within 30 minutes. In this case, the users in question will not be considered when calculating the monthly subscription fee.
-->

- For large companies, the monthly fee is calculated on a progressive scale.
