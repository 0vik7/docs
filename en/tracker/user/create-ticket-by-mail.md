# Creating an issue via email

To create an issue via email, send a message with the issue description to the [queue address](../manager/queue-mail.md):


1. Make sure the queue has its [email address](../manager/queue-mail.md#section_gwv_hqb_hgb) set up first.

1. Make sure you have [queue access](../manager/queue-access.md).

1. Create a new message.

    {% note tip %}

    Create a new message for every issue. If you respond to a {{ tracker-name }} email or send an existing email again, it will appear as an issue comment.

    {% endnote %}

1. Enter the issue name in the **Subject** field.

1. Describe the issue in the message body.

1. Send an email to the address specified in [queue settings](../manager/queue-mail.md#section_gwv_hqb_hgb).

You will receive a reply notifying you that a new issue was created.
