# How to make a dashboard your home page

You can make any available dashboard your [home page](startpage.md):

1. Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/tracker-settings.png) on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }} or follow the link: [https://tracker.yandex.ru/settings]({{ link-settings }}).

1. In the **My page** block, select **Dashboard** from the list and specify the dashboard you want to use as your home page.

    {% note tip %}

    If the dashboard you need is not on the list, make sure that you have [access to it](share-dashboard.md#section_k2z_1nk_pz) and [add it to your favorites](share-dashboard.md#section_gnx_s3l_pz).

    {% endnote %}

1. Click **Done**.
