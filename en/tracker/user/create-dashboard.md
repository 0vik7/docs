# Creating a dashboard

You can create multiple dashboards with different sets of widgets and switch between them as necessary. You can make any of your dashboards your home page or share it with a coworker.

To create a dashboard:

1. Select **Dashboards** â†’ **Create dashboard** on the {{ tracker-name }} top panel.

1. Enter a name for the dashboard and click **Create**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Edit** and select widgets one by one from the **Add** list to configure them. The following widgets are available in {{ tracker-name }}:

   - [Issues](widgets.md#tasks)
   - [Note](widgets.md#note)
   - [Summary table](widgets.md#summary-table)
   - [Summary table with totaled values](widgets.md#summary-table-with-totals)
   - [Events](widgets.md#events)
   - [Issue statistics](widgets.md#issues-stat)
   - [<q>Created/Solved</q> chart](widgets.md#created-and-resolved)

   Widgets let you view issue analytics. Issues are selected for widgets using a [query language](query-filter.md) or [filter](create-filter.md). You can select a filter from the list of preset and custom filters or set it manually right on the widget creation page.

1. Arrange the widgets however you like, set their sizes, and click **Save**.
