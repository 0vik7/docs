# Sharing a dashboard

You can share your dashboard with colleagues:

1. Open the dashboard page.

1. Copy the dashboard address and send it to the person you want to share it with.

By default, any user has read access to any dashboard.

If someone shares a dashboard with you, add it to Favorites so that you can always find it easily. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/favourites.svg) to the right of the dashboard name. Your favorite dashboards are available in the **Dashboards** menu on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}.
