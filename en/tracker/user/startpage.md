# Home page


To go to the home page, click the {{ tracker-name }} logo.

By default, this page displays the issue list from the [<q>All issues</q>](my-tickets.md) filter, meaning every issue that you're the reporter, assignee, or follower for.

You can set your home page to display any [filter](filters.md), [dashboard](dashboard.md), or [issue board](../manager/create-agile-board.md):

1. On the {{ tracker-name }} top panel, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/tracker-settings.png) â†’ **Personal settings**.

    
    {% note info %}

    You can also follow this link: [https://tracker.yandex.ru/settings]({{ link-settings }}).

    {% endnote %}

1. Choose a filter, dashboard, or issue board you want to see on the home page in the **My page** section.

1. Click **Save**.
