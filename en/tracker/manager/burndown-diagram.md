# Burn down charts

{% note warning %}

Sprints are enabled by default on boards with a **Backlog and sprints**. If you want to add a chart to a **Basic board**, [enable a backlog on it](backlog.md#add-backlog).

{% endnote %}

A burn down chart shows the issue completion rate and the remaining amount of work within a single [sprint](create-agile-sprint.md). Burn down charts are useful for evaluating whether the team will be able to solve the planned issues in time.

The chart's vertical axis shows the total workload left in **Story Points**, while the horizontal axis shows time. An ideal burndown chart should be close to a planned convergence line: it should start at a point with the maximum scope of work (the total of all issues in the sprint) on day 1 of the sprint and end at zero on the last day of the sprint.

To view the chart, go to the **Burndown chart** tab on the board. You will see the chart for the current sprint. If you hover over the chart, a pop-up window appears with information on the sprint status and changes to the scope of work in **Story points** for individual issues on a specific day. Clicking a point on the chart will fix the pop-up window so that you can open issues from it by clicking their names.
