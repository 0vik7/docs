You can use Yandex.Forms to set up your form to act as a template for creating issues as well as integrate it with the {{ tracker-name }} interface. Such form will be displayed on the issue creation page next to the basic one. It will help users create issues by following a preset template without feeling distracted by other fields and parameters.

## Step 1. Create and configure your form {#section_ovd_5hl_1gb}

1. Go to [Yandex.Forms]({{ link-forms }}). If it isn't activated, contact your organization's administration.

3. [Publish](https://yandex.com/support/connect-forms/common/publish.html#publish__section_lmk_gvb_tbb) the form and copy the link to it from the **Link** field.

## Step 2. Connect your form to the queue {#section_xxj_fll_1gb}
