# Creating a VM from a public image

To create a VM:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create the virtual machine in.
   1. Click **Create resource**.
   1. Select **Virtual machine**.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM.

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

   1. Select an [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to put your virtual machine in.
   1. Select a public image with the software you want to use.
   1. (optional) If you wish to add more disks to the virtual machine, [select them](../vm-create/create-from-disks.md) under **Disks and file storage** by clicking the **Disks** tab.
         1. (optional) If you wish to connect more file stores to the virtual machine, attach them under **Disks and file storage** by clicking the **File stores** tab. [Create](../filesystem/create.md) the storages first.
   1. Under **Computing resources**:
      * Choose a [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
      * Specify the [guaranteed share](../../concepts/performance-levels.md) and the required number of vCPUs as well as the amount of RAM.

      {% note info %}

      Each public image has its own minimum requirements for a virtual machine. A [GitLab](/marketplace/products/yc/gitlab) image from {{ marketplace-name }}, for instance, requires at least 4 virtual cores and 8 GB of RAM.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Under **Network settings**:
      * Enter a subnet ID or select a [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) from the list. You can select the search scope: in the current folder or in all folders. If you don't have a network, click **Create network** to create one:
         * In the window that opens, enter the folder to host the new network, as well as the network name.
         * Enable the option **Create subnets**: each network must have at least one [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
         * Click **Create**.
      * In the **Public IP** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
         * **Auto**: Assign a random IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} IP pool.
         * **List**: Select a public IP address from the list of previously reserved static addresses. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).
         * **No address**: Do not assign a public IP address.
      * (optional) Enable [DDoS protection](../../../vpc/ddos-protection/index.md), if required.
      * Select [appropriate security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) (if there is no corresponding field, the virtual machine will be enabled for all incoming and outgoing traffic).
   1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
      * (optional) Select or create a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#sa). By using a service account, you can flexibly configure access rights for your resources.
      * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
      * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the [public key](../vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) file.
      * (optional) Enable access to the [serial console](../index.md#serial-console), if required.
   1. Specify data required for accessing the VM.
   1. ClickÂ **Create VM**.

   VM creation takes several minutes. When the VM status changes to `RUNNING`, proceed to [configuring software](setup.md). You can monitor VM statuses on the list of VMs in the folder.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View the description of the CLI command for creating a VM:

      ```bash
      yc compute instance create --help
      ```

   1. Prepare the [key pair](../../operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) (a public key and a private one) for SSH access to the VM.
   1. Select one of the {{ marketplace-name }} public [images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

      {% include [id-info](../../../_includes/compute/id-info.md) %}

      {% include [standard-images](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

   1. Select a subnet:
      ```bash
      yc vpc subnet list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------+
      |          ID          |         NAME          |      NETWORK ID      | ROUTE TABLE ID |     ZONE      |      RANGE      |

      +----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------+
      ```
   1. Create a VM in the default folder:

      ```bash
      yc compute instance create \
        --name first-instance \
        --zone {{ region-id }}-a \
        --network-interface subnet-name=default-{{ region-id }}-a,nat-ip-version=ipv4 \
        --create-boot-disk image-folder-id=standard-images,image-family=centos-7 \
        --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
      ```

      Where:

      * `name`: VM name.

         {% include [name-fqdn](../../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

      * `zone`: Availability zone that corresponds to the selected subnet.
      * `subnet-name`: Name of the selected subnet.
      * `image-family`: [Image family](../../concepts/image.md#family), such as `centos-7`. This option allows you to install the latest version of the operating system from the specified family.
      * `nat-ip-version=ipv4`: Public IP. To create a VM without a public IP, disable this parameter.
      * `ssh-key`: Path to the public SSH key. The user `yc-user` will be automatically created on the VM for this key.

- {{ TF }}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_compute_instance" "linux-vm" {

        name        = "linux-vm"
        platform_id = "standard-v3"
        zone        = "<availability_zone>"

        resources {
          cores  = "<number_of_vCPU_cores>"
          memory = "<GB_of_RAM>"
        }

        boot_disk {
          initialize_params {
            image_id = "<image_ID"
          }
        }

        network_interface {
          subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.subnet-1.id
          nat       = true
        }

        metadata = {
          user-data = "#cloud-config\nusers:\n  - name: <username>\n    groups: sudo\n    shell: /bin/bash\n    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']\n    ssh-authorized-keys:\n      - ${file("<path_to_public_SSH_key>")}"
        }
      }

      resource "yandex_vpc_network" "network-1" {
        name = "network1"
      }

      resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "subnet-1" {
        name           = "subnet1"
        zone           = "<availability_zone>"
        v4_cidr_blocks = ["192.168.10.0/24"]
        network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.network-1.id
      }
      ```

      Where:

      * `yandex_compute_instance`: Description of the [VM](../../concepts/vm.md):
         * `name`: VM name.
         * `platform_id`: [Platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
         * `zone`: ID of the [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) that will host your VM.
         * `resources`: Number of vCPU cores and the amount of RAM available to the VM. The values must match the selected [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
         * `boot_disk`: Boot disk settings. Specify the ID of the selected image. You can get the image ID from the [list of public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

            {% include [id-info](../../../_includes/compute/id-info.md) %}

         * `network_interface`: Network settings. Specify the ID of the selected subnet. To automatically assign a public IP address to the VM, set `nat = true`.
         * `metadata`: In metadata, provide the username and public key for accessing the VM via SSH. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/vm-metadata.md).
      * `yandex_vpc_network`: Description of the [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
      * `yandex_vpc_subnet`: Description of [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) your virtual machine will connect to.

      {% note info %}

      If you already have suitable resources, such as a cloud network and subnet, you do not need to describe them again. Use their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

      {% endnote %}

      For more information about the resources that you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/compute_instance).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```bash
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```bash
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.
