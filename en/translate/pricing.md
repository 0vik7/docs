| Number of characters in requests<br/>for the Reporting Period | Rate per 1 million characters,<br/> without VAT | Rate per 1 million characters,<br/> incl. VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

| Translation, over 1 billion characters | 216.1 ₽ | 255 ₽ |

### Example {#example}

During the Reporting Period, you sent 1 billion 125 million characters for translation. The rates will be applied as follows:

  * For the first billion characters, you will pay at the rate <q>Up to 1 billion characters</q>.
  * For the remaining 125 million characters, you will pay at the rate <q>Over 1 billion characters</q>.

The total cost for using Yandex.Translate is calculated by the formula:

```
Estimated cost =
    (Cost for 1 million characters at the rate "Up to 1 billion characters") * 1000
    +
    (Cost for 1 million characters at the rate "Over 1 billion characters") * 125
```
