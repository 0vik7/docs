# Object backup

{{ objstorage-name }} ensures reliable replicated storage of your uploaded objects, but doesn't provide dedicated backup tools.

If you want to store backup copies of your objects, you can regularly download the objects you need from {{ objstorage-name }} and store them in your own infrastructure or other cloud storage.

To automate the backup process, use [tools supported by the service](../tools/index.md).
