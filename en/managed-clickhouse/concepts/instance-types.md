# Host classes

A host class must be selected when creating each cluster. The class determines the computing power to be allocated for each DB host in the cluster.

The available storage does not depend on the host class.  For storage limitations, see the section [[!TITLE]](limits.md)

## Available host classes {#available-flavors}

If you change the host class, the characteristics of all hosts in the cluster change, too.

Host class name | Number of CPU | RAM, GB
----- | ----- | -----
s1.nano | 1 | 4
s1.micro | 2 | 8
s1.small | 4 | 16
s1.medium | 8 | 32
s1.large | 16 | 64
s1.xlarge | 32 | 128
