# Network and DB clusters in {{ mch-name }}


When creating a {{ CH }} cluster, you can:

* Specify a network for the entire cluster.

* Specify subnets for each host in the cluster.

* Request public access to connect to the cluster from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.

You can create a cluster without specifying any subnets for the hosts if the availability zone selected for each host contains exactly one subnet of the cluster network.


## Host name and FQDN {#hostname}

{{ mch-short-name }} generates the name of each cluster host when creating it. This name will be the host's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The host name and, consequently, the FQDN cannot be changed.


You can use the FQDN to access the host within a single cloud network. For more information, see the [{{ vpc-full-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).

## Public access to a host {#public-access-to-a-host}

Any cluster host can be accessible from outside {{ yandex-cloud }} if you requested public access when creating the host. To connect to such a host, use its FQDN.

You cannot request a public address after creating a host; however, you can replace one of the existing hosts with a new one that has a public address.

When deleting a host with a public FQDN, the assigned IP address is revoked.

## Security groups {#security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules-limits](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-limits.md) %}

{% note tip %}

When connecting to a cluster from within its cloud network, make sure to [configure](../operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) security groups both for the cluster and for the connecting host.
