# Monitoring resource usage during the trial period

At the beginning of the trial period, a grant is credited to your billing account that expires after 60 days. You can spend the credited amount to pay for various Yandex.Cloud resources. The trial period ends automatically when you spend the entire grant amount or after 60 days, whichever is earlier.

During the trial period, you can [view statistics](../../billing/operations/check-diagram.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rates. The reports are available on the [Billing](https://cloud.yandex.com/console/billing) page in the management console.

You can also use the management console to find out how much of the grant is still available to you and how many days are left until the end of the trial period.
