# Upgrading to the paid version

You will not upgrade to the paid version automatically after the end of the trial period. To upgrade to the paid version, go to the **Billing** page in the management console and click **Upgrade to the paid version**.

If you upgrade to the paid version before the end of the trial period, the remainder of the grant provided for the Trial Period will be available as a discount that you can use to pay for use of cloud resources.

For more information on how to pay for resources after upgrading to the paid version, read the [documentation](../../billing/) for the Billing service.
