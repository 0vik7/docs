To grant access to a partner account:

{% list tabs %}

- Partner portal

  1. Log in to the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}) with the Yandex ID to which your partner account in {{ yandex-cloud }} is linked. If you have no access, it means the account you use to log in has no partner status assigned.
  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![icon](../../../_assets/partner/dashboard.svg) **Dashboard**.
  1. Click the **Access bindings** tab.
  1. In the top-right corner, click **Add user**.
  1. In the window that opens, enter the user's email address and click **Add**.
  1. In the **Configure access bindings** window, specify the user [roles](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md).

  The user will get access to the partner portal and an option to add customers.
