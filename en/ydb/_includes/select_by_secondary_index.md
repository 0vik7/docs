To make a [SELECT](../yql/reference/syntax/select.md) by secondary index statement, use the following construction:

```sql
SELECT * 
    FROM [TableName]:IndexName
    WHERE â€¦
```

**Examples**

* Select all the fields from the `series` table using the `views_index` index with the `views >=someValue` criteria:

  ```sql
  SELECT series_id, title, info, release_date, views, uploaded_user_id
      FROM [series]:views_index
      WHERE views >= someValue
  ```

* [JOIN](../yql/reference/syntax/join.md) the `series` and `users` tables on the `userName` field using the `users_index` and `name_index` indexes, respectively:

  ```sql
  SELECT t1.series_id, t1.title
      FROM [series]:users_index AS t1
      INNER JOIN [users]:name_index AS t2
      ON t1.uploaded_user_id == t2.user_id
      WHERE t2.name == userName;
  ```
