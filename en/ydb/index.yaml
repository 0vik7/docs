- "<i>Yandex Database</i> (YDB) is a distributed fault tolerant NewSQL DBMS. YDB provides high availability and scalability, while ensuring strong consistency and support for ACID transactions. Queries are made using a declarative SQL-like query language called YQL."
- "YDB can be an alternative to other solutions in the following cases: <ul> <li>In systems demanding ACID transaction support between tables loaded unevenly over time.</li> <li>In systems that need to process and store large amounts of data.</li> <li>When developing a new product natively designed for expected high loads (thousands of database queries per second) and strong consistency.</li> <li>As a backend for databases with poorly predictable loads.</li> </ul>"
