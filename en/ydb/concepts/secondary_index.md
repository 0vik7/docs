## Adding a secondary index {#add-secondary-index}

To add a secondary index when [creating a table](../yql/reference/syntax/create_table.md#si-add), use the statement `INDEX IndexName GLOBAL ON (SomeKey1, ... SomeKeyN)`.

## Select by secondary index {#select-by-secondary-index}

To make a [SELECT](../yql/reference/syntax/select.md#si-select) by secondary index data query, use the following construction:

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM [TableName]:IndexName
    WHERE â€¦
```
